// checkpoint() and finalize_close() are both fully permissionless (see
// channel.service.ts's comment on checkpointChannel/finalizeCloseChannel),
// so the facilitator can drive them on its own authority with no live
// party signature needed. In-process @Cron(), not a separate Railway
// service — deliberate, see the approved plan (Step 4): a standalone
// "channel-keeper" service would need its own railwayConfigFile, deploy
// pipeline, and crash/restart story, which is exactly the extra surface
// that caused a real multi-day production bug elsewhere in this codebase
// (backup-cron silently sharing api's root railway.json). The keeper needs
// the same Postgres pool and Soroban signer api already owns, so coupling
// its uptime to api's restarts is a reasonable, explicit trade.
//
// Idle-close is NOT implemented here. This is a real architectural gap
// found while building this, not a deferred nice-to-have: initiate_close()
// requires require_auth() from the channel's payer or payee specifically
// (konfirm-contracts/contracts/channel/src/lib.rs:222-227) — the
// facilitator is neither party in the general case (an agent pays a
// resource server; Konfirm just relays), so there is no live signature for
// the keeper to relay on an idle channel, unlike checkpoint()/
// finalize_close(), which need no party auth at all. logIdleChannels()
// below still surfaces idle channels so the gap is visible operationally,
// but does not attempt (and fail) an initiate_close() call the keeper has
// no authority to make. The real fix needs an open-time or contract design
// change (e.g. an optional delegated-closer address captured by
// open_channel) — out of scope here since it touches the deployed
// contract, not just the backend.
