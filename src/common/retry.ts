// Wraps any external call with a hard timeout and exponential-backoff
// retry. Deliberately generic (works for an SDK method, a raw fetch, or
// anything else async) rather than reaching into stellar-sdk's internal
// HTTP client for a library-specific mechanism.
//
// This is safe to apply broadly to *reads* (loadAccount, status polls,
// challenge fetches) but not to every external call — a POST that creates
// state on the far side (starting a SEP-24 interactive session, for
// instance) can't be blindly retried on a timeout: if the first attempt
// actually succeeded and only the response was lost, a retry creates a
// second, orphaned transaction on the anchor's side. Call sites decide
// per-operation whether a retry is safe; this helper just does the
// mechanics once real anchor-specific idempotency guarantees are known.

// a transport-level failure or a 5xx response counts as retryable — a 4xx
// response is returned immediately for the caller to turn into whatever
// error message makes sense for that endpoint.
