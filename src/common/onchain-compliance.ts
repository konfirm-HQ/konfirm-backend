// until now) — no CLI binary, no container-runtime shared-library
// dependencies, and meaningfully faster (a single simulate-only RPC call
// vs. spawning and waiting on an external process). Same documented
// invariant as before: fails open, loudly, on any error — an unreachable
// compliance check must never silently block a payment, but must never be
// silent about it either.
//
// Client construction (getClient()) and the actual call both happen
// *inside* the retried, timeout-bounded closure — not just the call. A
// native `execFile` timeout (the old CLI approach) really kills the child
// process; a Promise-based race around only *part* of an async chain
// doesn't stop the untimed part from hanging indefinitely, it just stops
// the caller from waiting on it. Wrapping both together is what actually
// bounds this call's worst-case latency now that there's no child process
// to kill.
